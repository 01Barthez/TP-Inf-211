Managing a supermarket‚Äôs stock can be challenging, with numerous products, suppliers, and inventory processes to oversee. As a developer for Dovv Supermarket in Biyem-Assi, Yaounde you‚Äôve been tasked with creating a stock management system. This system will organize products by categories, manage supplier and customer data, track product inventory, and streamline the ordering and restocking process.

## Students Informations

Matricule: 22T2959

### Exercise 1: Define Classes and Attributes

Here I Identify and define the main classes necessary for the stock management system. For each class, I‚Äôll list its attributes and methods

1 - Supermaket
    ‚Ä¢ Attributes: id, name, location, addressInfo, suppliers, products, customers, orders.
    ‚Ä¢ Methods: displayInfo().

2 - Supplier
    ‚Ä¢ Attributes: id, name, contactInfo, gender, productsSupplied
    ‚Ä¢ Methods: supplyProduct(), addSupplier(), getSupplierInfos(), deleteSupplier().

3 - Customer
    ‚Ä¢ Attributes: id, name, contactInfo, gender, orderHistory
    ‚Ä¢ Methods: placeOrder(), addCustomer(), getCustomerInfos(), deleteCustomer().
    ‚Ä¢ 
4 - Product
    ‚Ä¢ Attributes: id, name, price, quantity, category, supplier_id, 
    ‚Ä¢ Methods: createProduct(), restockProduct(), getProductInfos(), updateProduct(), deleteProduct().

5 - Order
    ‚Ä¢ Attributes: id, customer, products, quantities, totalPrice
    ‚Ä¢ Methods: processOrder(), cancelOrder(), getOrder(), createOrder().
### Exercise 2: Create a UML Diagram

Here I create a UML class diagram based on the classes and relationships defined
in Exercise 1 above; The diagram clearly show how the Product, Supplier, Customer, and Order classes relate to each other; Its Include inheritance, associations, and multiplicities; its also include key attributes and methods for each class.

The Diagramm was drawed with starUML app, and this picture show the result.
For mor information you can upload the model using the file ‚ÄúUML-diagram-TP.mdj‚Äù in  a root folder.

### Exercise 3: Create a UML Diagram

JavaScript Version : 
For this version we have to begin by make sure that a node is install (execute ```node ‚Äìversion``` my result: ‚Äúv22.12.0‚Äù), and after that, make sure that packet who automatically generate ID is present, if is not present, we‚Äôll install it using the command ```npm install``` or ```npm install uuid```.

To execute and test my files, me have to run the command: 
```node path_to_file/name_of_file.ext```

For example to run index file, the command is: 
```node index.js```
 For the Supermarket file, the command is: 
```node models/Supermaket.js```
(NB: This command supposing that y‚Äôre on the root of the project).

to execute some file, just type: ```python3 path_to_file/name_of_file.ext```
Just make sure that y‚Äôre on root dir.

C++Version :
Here is also relaively simple‚Ä¶
once in a root directory, 
-switched to build folder by executing : ```cd build```.
-Genereate the build file: ```cmake ..```
-Compile the projet: ```make```
- Execute the projet: ```./supermarket_app```

It‚Äôs also important to make sure that y‚Äôve install this in local to avoid mistakes:```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install uuid-dev```

 
Java Version :
Here is also simple to run the file, just run the command: 


Result:

For the test that I made, the result we be: 
```bash
